bio: Roanna qualified as a Physiotherapist from the University of Birmingham in 2002 and started her career at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust (SWBH). Her first rotation was in musculoskeletal outpatients which launched her interest in MSK. Roanna later left the NHS to work for the MOD (RAF) for seven years as an Advanced Physiotherapist treating largely acute injuries and working collaboratively within an occupational health remit. At this point Roanna undertook her MSc in Advancing Practice (Manipulative Physiotherapy) which she completed in 2010 becomming a member of the Musculoskeletal Association of Chartered Physiotherapists (MACP). Having completed her MSc she took up a Consultant Physiotherapist role for Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust. As a clinical leader Roanna developed a strong interest in measuring and demonstrating service efficacy and developing service improvement initiatives. She then made the move back to my roots to take up a Consultant Physiotherapist/MSK Lead post for SWBH NHS Trust in 2014, co-leading a large physiotherapy service and community orthopaedic triage service, alongside part-time work for the University of Birmingham lecturing on manual therapy and sports medicine MSc programmes, and teaching and examining on MACP clinical placements. With her continued interest in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) research, and evaluation and benchmarking of services she later stepped out of my teaching role to take up a PhD opportunity at Keele University under the guidance of Dr Jonathan Hill entitled; ‘Benchmarking MSK Services’. Rossana is now split between her Consultant role and PhD study which she am due to complete in 2022, with post-doctoral plans to develop a national MSK audit in community and primary care.
